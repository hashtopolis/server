Hashtopolis is a multi-platform client-server tool for distributing hashcat tasks to multiple computers. The main goals for Hashtopolis's development are portability, robustness, multi-user support, and multiple groups management.

To report a bug, please create an issue and try to describe the problem as accurately as possible. This helps us to identify the bug and see if it is reproducible.

In an effort to make the Hashtopussy project conform to a more politically neutral name it was rebranded to "Hashtopolis" in March 2018.

## Setup and Usage

Please consult the [documentation](https://docs.hashtopolis.org) for more information on setup, upgrade and usage.

## Contribution Guidelines

We are open to all kinds of contributions. If it's a bug fix or a new feature, feel free to create a pull request. Please consider some points:

* Just include one feature or one bugfix in one pull request. In case you have two new features please also create two pull requests.
* Try to stick with the code style used (especially in the PHP parts). IntelliJ/PHPStorm users can get a code style XML [here](https://gist.github.com/s3inlc/226ed78b05eb6dc8f60f18d6fd310d74).

The pull request will then be reviewed by at least one member and merged after approval. Don't be discouraged just because the first review is not approved, often these are just small changes.
