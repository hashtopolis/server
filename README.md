# Hashtopussy 

This is a wrapper for hashcat for distributed hashcracking, based on the source code of Hashtopus. 

Notice: We decided to just publish Hashtopussy working with hashcat v3 and not focussing on also supporting the older versions. 
If you would like to use Hashtopussy with the older versions, please checkout commit cdf2857067c9613f546f7428be95e5a7c0255d0f where it was the state before adding hc v3 support.
