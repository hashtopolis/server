# Agents

An **agent** is a Hashtopolis client instance that performs password cracking with a cracker binary, typically hashcat. It requests work from the server, processes it on assigned devices (CPU or GPU), and reports the results back.

A machine is not limited to only one agent â€” multiple agents can run on the same machine. For example, a server with multiple GPUs can run several agents, each assigned to a different GPU, allowing better control and parallel task execution.

For installing new agents, please refer to the [dedicated section](../installation_guidelines/basic_install.md#agent-installation) within the installation manual.


## Show Agents

All registered agents are shown in a table on this page, which contains the following fields:

- **Active**: Checkbox to enable or disable the agent manually. Agents are automatically disabled if they encounter repeated Hashcat errors, unless configured to ignore such errors.
- **ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each agent by the system.
- **Status**: Current operational status of the agent (e.g., idle, running, offline, error).
- **Name**: The name of the agent, which by default is the hostname at the time of registration.
- **Owner**: The user responsible for this agent, blank by default.
- **Client**: Version of the Hashtopolis client software the agent is running.
- **GPUs/CPUs**: Number and type of devices (GPUs and/or CPUs) available on this agent for cracking.
- **Last Activity**: Timestamp of the most recent communication including the IP of the agent.
- **Access Group**: The group(s) this agent belongs to, controlling access to tasks and hashlists.
- **Task**: ID of the current task assigned to the agent, if any.
- **Chunk**: ID of the specific portion of the task the agent is currently processing.
- **Speed**: The current hash cracking speed reported by the agent (hashes per second).
- **Cracked**: Number of passwords cracked by this agent so far.

## Agent Status

This page provides a visual overview of the status of all agents, including real-time performance and health metrics:

- Visual graphs showing **device utilization** for both CPU and GPU agents.
- Temperature readings for each device, helping detect overheating or hardware issues.

The visuals use the following color code:

- **Green**: All good
- **Orange**: Warning
- **Red**: Value too low
- **Light blue**: Agent is connected but does not communicate metrics (e.g. no task assigned or downloading data)
- **Grey**: Agent inactive or no communication received

## Agent Overview 
***(To be checked with the new interface)***


Clicking on an agent in the list opens the **Agent Overview** page, which provides detailed information and management options for that agent as described below:


- **Agent ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each agent by the system.
- **Active**: Checkbox to enable or disable the agent manually. Agents are automatically disabled if they encounter repeated Hashcat errors, unless configured to ignore such errors.
- **Last Activity**: Timestamp of the most recent communication including the IP of the agent.
- **Owner**: The user responsible for this agent, blank by default.
- **Machine Name**: The name given to the agent, by default the hostname at the registration time.
- **Operating System**: Icon indicating the OS (e.g., Windows, Linux) on which the agent is running.
- **Access Token**: Unique token used by the agent for authentication with the server.
- **Machine ID**: Unique hardware or system identifier for the agent's machine.
- **CPU Only Agent**: Indicates whether the agent uses only CPU resources or includes GPUs as well.
- **Graphic Cards**: Detailed list of GPUs detected and used by the agent.
- **Member of Access Groups**: Lists all access groups the agent belongs to.
- **Extra Parameters**: Arguments passed to the agent and automatically included in the command line of any task, such as the *'-w3'* flag.
- **Cracker Errors**: Folding menu to decide how the agent should behave when an error is encountered.
- **Trust**: Trust level or rating of the agent, possibly based on performance or error history.
- **Assignment**: Current task and chunk assigned to this agent.
- **Time Spent Cracking**: Total time the agent has spent actively cracking hashes.

Similar to the ***Agent Status*** page, this view includes charts of recent temperature and utilization trends for all devices used by this agent. 

- **Device(s) Temperatures**: Current temperatures of GPUs and/or CPUs.
- **Device(s) Utilization**: Current utilization percentages for each device.
- **Agent Average CPU Utilization**: Average CPU usage over a recent period.
- **Error Messages**: Any error messages generated by the agent or Hashcat.
- **Dispatched Chunks**: Shows information about the last 50 chunks assigned to this agent.
