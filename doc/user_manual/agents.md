# Agents Overview

Assuming you have your agents registered, you will see them in this list along with lots of useful information:

Act This little check box enabled/disables the agent. Should a Hashcat error occur, the agent will be deactivated automatically unless 'Ignore errors' is enabled for it.
Machine Name This is the actual machine name.
Owner User name of the agent owner.
OS A little icon identifying Windows from Linux.
Devices A shortened list of detected GPU cards. Hover mouse for full text.
Last activity Tells you what, when and from what IP has the agent done last.
Important thing is that agent ID and Name are click-able, which will get you to agent detail page. On this page, you can see all of the information from before plus some more.

Extra Parameters Agent Specific command line options (--force, --workload-profile or --gpu-temp-disable)
Trust only trusted agents will be allowed to crack tasks with secret hashlist or files
Error ignoring the agent will not be deactivated if an error occurs.
