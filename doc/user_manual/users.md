## All Users

Hashtopolis is a multi-user platform so it is possible to create and manage new users.

In the **user area** there is an overview which shows all relevant information about the created users:

For example, the last login date and the associated permission group are tracked.

### Creating a new User

To create a new user you have to click on New-User. You can then specify a user name and the corresponding e-mail address. In addition, the user must be given appropriate rights, i.e. assigned to a so-called permission group
