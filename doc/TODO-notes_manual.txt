# What still has to be done
- in advanced install there should be a note about files in www-data format etc
- lots of screenshots and diagrams to make the text fancier
- details about the config files, structure of repos etc.
- booting from PxE, running hashtopolis as a service ?
- Check if any difference for Agent overview in new interface
- Hashtypes
- make an example of import super task to make it clearer
- Task overview is missing !!!
